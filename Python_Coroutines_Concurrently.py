# Python Coroutines and Tasks. 
# Coroutines declared with async/await syntax is the preferred way of writing asyncio applications.
#
# To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:
#
# > The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function.
# > Awaiting on a coroutine. 
# > The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.
# Running two 'say_after' function coroutines concurrently:
 
async def main():

    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)

    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
