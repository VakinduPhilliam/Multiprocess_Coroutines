# Python Coroutines and Tasks. 
# Coroutines declared with async/await syntax is the preferred way of writing asyncio applications.
#
# To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:
#
# > The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function.
# > Awaiting on a coroutine. 
# > The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.
#
# The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:
# 

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):

    await asyncio.sleep(delay)

    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
